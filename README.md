# UFOs

Overview of the analysis:
To create a searchable webpage of UFO sightings data for the genereal public using Java Script inserted into an HTML page. 

Results:
There is a brief introduction about the website at the beginning but the real focus is having a searchable repository of data for end users. Search by date, location of the sighting - either city, state or country. Users can even search by the shape of the UFO sited. This allows users to potentially track the same UFO sitings in different locations and could potentially track the UFOs movements here on earth. 

Summary:
Althought it is wonderful to search the various sitings, adding multipl lcations such a boolean search would be helpful. New data is also one draw back It would be great to have a function where users can add their own UFO sitings. 

Adding an addition for new content would be my first recommendation. It would also be helpful to have a database of people who have seen the UFO's. That would be a great way for other UFO believers to network and share their experiences.
